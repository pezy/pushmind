message: "I think what you published made a lot of sense. But, consider \r\nthis, suppose you were to create a awesome post title?\r\nI ain't suggesting your information is not good, but suppose you added a headline to maybe grab a person's attention? I mean 我的 Github Pages 折腾史 &mdash; 推思 is kinda \r\nplain. You should glance at Yahoo's home page and see how they create news headlines to grab viewers to \r\nclick. You might add a video or a related pic or two to get people excited about what you've written. Just my \r\nopinion, it would make your website a little livelier."
