message: "I think that everything wrote was actually very reasonable.\r\nHowever, what about this? suppose you were to create a \r\nawesome post title? I am not suggesting your content is not good, but what if \r\nyou added a headline that grabbed people's attention? I mean 我的 Github Pages 折腾史 &mdash; 推思 is kinda boring.\r\nYou should peek at Yahoo's front page and watch how they create post headlines to grab people interested.\r\nYou might add a video or a picture or two to grab people interested about everything've got to say.\r\nJust my opinion, it could bring your posts a little livelier."
